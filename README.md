install
========

1. Make sure you have the devtools package installed and loaded in your libraries:
```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

2. Call the installation with the name of the package (uberplot in our case) and username (heshan0131 in our case) in GitHub (assuming a public repo, that needs no password to access):

```
install_github("uberplot", username="heshan0131")
library(medplot)
```
